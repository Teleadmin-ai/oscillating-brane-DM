# Complete Theoretical Framework

The oscillating brane dark matter theory represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of the cosmos. Here we present the complete mathematical framework and physical insights.

## Core Concepts

### The Brane Universe
Our 4D spacetime is an elastic membrane floating in a 5D bulk. This isn't merely a mathematical abstraction—it's the fundamental nature of reality.

### Gravitational Funnels
Black holes serve as conduits between our brane and the bulk, allowing dark matter to oscillate through the extra dimension.

### Fundamental Oscillation
The entire universe vibrates as a single entity with a period of approximately 2 billion years, creating the effects we attribute to dark energy.

## Mathematical Framework

### Energy of the Membrane

The deformation energy of the cosmic membrane is:

$$E_{tens} = \frac{1}{2} τ_0 A \left(\frac{2πz}{λ}\right)^2$$

Where:
- τ₀ = 7.0 × 10¹⁹ J/m² is the brane tension
- A ≃ R_H² is the area of the observable universe
- z is the displacement in the extra dimension
- λ ≃ 2R_H is the fundamental wavelength

### Dark Energy Equation of State

The oscillating membrane creates a time-varying dark energy:

$$w(z) = -1 + A_w \sin\left(\frac{2π t_{lb}(z)}{T}\right)$$

With amplitude A_w ≃ 0.003 and period T = 2.0 Gyr.

### Modified Gravity

At low accelerations, the membrane's properties create MOND-like effects:

$$a_0 = \frac{cH_0}{2π} × ξ ≃ 1.1 × 10^{-10} \text{ m/s}^2$$

## Key Predictions

1. **Oscillating dark energy** detectable by Euclid and DESI
2. **Gravitational wave signature** at f₀ ≈ 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁷ Hz
3. **Growth suppression** reconciling Planck and weak lensing
4. **Hubble anisotropy** mapping cosmic tension variations
