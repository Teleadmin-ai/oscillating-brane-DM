# Cosmic Chronology

## From Inflation to Current Oscillations

The evolution of brane tension from the Big Bang to today reveals how the universe tuned itself to its fundamental frequency.

## Timeline of Brane Evolution

| Phase | Age | τ (J/m²) | Description |
|-------|-----|----------|-------------|
| Inflation | 0 → 10⁻³⁴ s | 10⁵⁰ | Quasi-exponential expansion, hyper-tense brane |
| Brane Reheating | 10⁻³⁴ → 10⁻³² s | 10³⁰ | Tension decay via MN-antiMN production in bulk |
| Relaxation | 10⁻³² s → 1 Gyr | 10²⁷ → 7×10¹⁹ | τ ∝ t⁻¹/², fundamental mode enters resonance ≈ 1 Gyr |
| Current Era | 13.8 Gyr | 7×10¹⁹ | Stable oscillation with 2 Gyr period |

## Physical Processes

### Inflation Phase
The brane begins with near-Planckian tension, driving exponential expansion. The extreme curvature prevents any oscillatory modes.

### Brane Reheating
As inflation ends, the brane tension converts to particle production:
- Massive MN-antiMN pairs created in the bulk
- Energy density transfers from geometric to matter sector
- Tension drops by 20 orders of magnitude

### Relaxation Era
The brane tension follows a power law decay:

$$\tau(t) = \tau_0 \left(\frac{t_0}{t}\right)^{1/2}$$

This natural cooling allows the fundamental mode to enter resonance when the oscillation period matches the age of the universe.

### Current Oscillations
Today, the brane has reached its equilibrium configuration:
- Stable tension τ₀ = 7×10¹⁹ J/m²
- Fundamental period T = 2.0 Gyr
- 10% of dark matter participates in oscillations

## Connection to Standard Cosmology

Our framework preserves all successful predictions of ΛCDM while adding:
1. Natural explanation for dark energy timing
2. Mechanism for MOND-like effects at large scales
3. Testable oscillations in cosmological observables

The brane paradigm unifies inflation, dark matter, and dark energy into a single geometric framework.
