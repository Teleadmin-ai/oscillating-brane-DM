# Oscillating Brane Dark Matter Theory v4.0

## The Universe as a Vibrating Membrane

This repository contains the complete theoretical framework and computational tools for the **Oscillating Brane Dark Matter Theory**, where the universe is conceptualized as a 4D elastic membrane floating in higher dimensions, with dark matter flows through gravitational funnels exciting fundamental vibrational modes.

### 🌌 Key Predictions

| Phenomenon | Theoretical Value | Cosmic Significance |
|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Brane tension | τ₀ = 7.0 × 10¹⁹ J/m² | The elasticity of spacetime fabric |
| Oscillation period | T = 2.0 ± 0.3 Gyr | The cosmic heartbeat |
| MOND acceleration | a₀ = 1.1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m/s² | Gravity at the confines |
| S₈ suppression | -5.2% | Restored harmony |
| Bayesian evidence | Δln K = 3.33 ± 0.24 | Promise of truth |

### 📖 Theory Overview

Imagine the universe not as a vast void punctuated by stars, but as the skin of an infinitely extended cosmic drum. This elastic membrane—our four-dimensional reality—floats in an ocean of hidden dimensions. Black holes are not destructive chasms but tension pegs, anchor points where the membrane folds and plunges elsewhere. And dark matter? It is the invisible bow that vibrates this giant harp, creating a two-billion-year melody where each note shapes space, time, and gravity itself.

### 🔬 Core Concepts

1. **The Brane Universe**: Our 4D spacetime as an elastic membrane in a 5D bulk
2. **Gravitational Funnels**: Black holes as conduits for dark matter oscillations
3. **Fundamental Mode**: The universe vibrates as a whole with period T ≈ 2 Gyr
4. **Emergent Dark Energy**: Oscillating equation of state w(z) from membrane dynamics
5. **Modified Gravity**: MOND-like effects emerge naturally at low accelerations

### 🚀 Quick Start

```python
# Calculate the oscillating dark energy equation of state
from scripts.brane_dynamics import BraneOscillator

brane = BraneOscillator(
    tau_0=7.0e19,  # J/m²
    f_osc=0.10,    # Oscillating fraction
    T=2.0          # Gyr
)

# Get w(z) at redshift z=0.5
z = 0.5
w_de = brane.equation_of_state(z)
print(f"w(z={z}) = {w_de:.3f}")
```

### 🔮 Future Tests

| Mission | Target Signature | Refutation Threshold |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Euclid | Sinusoidal w(z) | A ≥ 3×10⁻³, Signal < 5σ |
| DESI Full | ΔP/P = 0.5% at k₀ | Smooth spectrum |
| IPTA DR5 | Doublet f₀, 2f₀ | Pure noise |
| H0LiCOW++ | Anisotropy ≤ 1.5% | Isotropy < 0.2% |
