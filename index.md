# Welcome to Oscillating Brane Cosmology

<div class="section-marker" data-section="intro"></div>

## The Universe as a Vibrating Cosmic Membrane

Imagine the universe not as a vast void punctuated by stars, but as the skin of an infinitely extended cosmic drum. This elastic membrane—our four-dimensional reality—floats in an ocean of hidden dimensions.

## Revolutionary Insights

Our theory presents a paradigm shift in understanding cosmic dynamics:

- **Black holes** are not destructive chasms but tension pegs, anchor points where the membrane folds
- **Dark matter** is the invisible bow that vibrates this giant harp
- **Dark energy** emerges naturally from membrane oscillations
- **Modified gravity** appears at cosmic scales without new particles

## Cosmic Evolution

The universe began with a violent birth, the brane appearing with quasi-Planckian tension. Through phases of inflation, reheating, and slow stabilization, it found its natural frequency and began its two-billion-year oscillation.

## The Oscillating Universe

Every two billion years, the cosmic membrane completes one full cycle. This oscillation creates the dark energy we observe, modulates structure formation, and leaves its fingerprint in the cosmic microwave background.

## Future Tests

The coming decade will be decisive. Euclid will measure the dark energy equation of state with unprecedented precision. DESI will map the power spectrum modulation. Pulsar timing arrays will search for our gravitational wave signature.
