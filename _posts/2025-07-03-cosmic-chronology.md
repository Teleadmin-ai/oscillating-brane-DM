In our framework, the cosmic membrane has evolved dramatically from its violent birth to its current gentle oscillation. This chronology reveals how the universe tuned itself to play its fundamental melody.

## The Violent Birth

The brane appears at the Big Bang with quasi-Planckian tension τ_BB ~ 10⁵⁰ J/m²—a membrane stretched to breaking point, vibrating with pure energy.

### Phase I - Trans-membrane Inflation (0 - 10⁻³⁴ s)

The colossal excess tension fuels exponential expansion. The membrane expands like a soap bubble blown by a hurricane, creating space from dimensional nothingness.

### Phase II - Brane Reheating (10⁻³⁴ - 10⁻³² s)

Tension drops brutally via massive production of dark matter/anti-dark matter pairs in the bulk. This "quantum evaporation" dissipates excess energy, leaving residual tension around 10³⁰ J/m².

### Phase III - Slow Stabilization (10⁻³² s - 100 Myr)

Tension relaxes logarithmically toward its current value. Like a violin string being tuned, the membrane seeks its natural frequency.

## The Awakening of Oscillations

Only when τ becomes "loose enough" does the fundamental mode enter the T ~ 2 Gyr band. Oscillation starts about 1 Gyr after the Big Bang—exactly when Ringermacher & Mead observe the first oscillation in scale factor a(t)!

This temporal coincidence is no accident: it's the moment when the universe, finally tuned, begins playing its fundamental melody.

## The Living Universe

Our final vision: the cosmos is not an inert theater but a living organism:

| Phase | Time | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Birth** | Big Bang | Maximum tension, first breath |
| **Childhood** | 0-1 Gyr | Relaxation, frequency tuning |
| **Maturity** | 1-50 Gyr | Established oscillations (we are here) |
| **Old Age** | 50-100 Gyr | Progressive damping |
| **Silence** | >100 Gyr | Strings relax, space forgets distance |

## The Tension Calibration

The time for one complete oscillation follows the universal law:

$$T = 2π\sqrt{\frac{M_{osc}}{k_{eff}}} = 2π\sqrt{\frac{f_{osc} M_{DM,tot}}{τ_0}}$$

Inverting for the observed period T = 2.0 Gyr:

$$τ_0 = f_{osc} M_{DM,tot} \left(\frac{2π}{T}\right)^2 = 7.0 × 10^{19} \text{ J/m}^2$$

This value, neither arbitrary nor adjusted, emerges naturally from the system's physics.

## MONDian Gravity: Lazy Space

Beyond masses, in vast cosmic voids, spacetime becomes "lazy"—it resists movement differently. This laziness manifests as a threshold acceleration:

$$a_0 = \frac{cH_0}{2π} × ξ = 1.1 × 10^{-10} \text{ m/s}^2$$

The factor ξ ≃ 1.05 encodes the informational content of the horizon—how many quantum "bits" define each cell of space.

## Local Anisotropies: Mapping Tension

Local tension variation induces variation in the Hubble "constant":

$$\frac{δH}{H} ≃ \frac{1}{2} \frac{δτ}{τ_0} ≃ \frac{1}{2} γK_{MW} \sim 10^{-4}$$

A future program capable of measuring H₀ directionally at 0.05% precision over 10° patches could reveal this cosmic tension map—regions where the membrane is tighter expand slightly faster!
